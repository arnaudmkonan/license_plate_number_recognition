abstract="In our work, we concentrate on the problem of car license plate recognition after the plate has been extracted from an image. Traditional methods approach this problem as three separate steps: preprocessing, segmentation, and recognition. In this paper, we propose a unified approach that integrates these steps using a fully convolutional network. We train a 36-class FCN on a dataset of single characters and apply it to height-normalized license plates. The architecture of this model successfully reduces the loss in detail during end-to-end convolution. Finally, we extract the results from the output sequences of probabilities using a variant of the NMS algorithm. The experiments on public license plate datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",
