%% EECS442 Final Project
% Group Lamborghini
% Composed by Jiongsheng Cai, Jingyao Hu, Yucheng Yin
% Generally, we solve the problem of license plate number recognition
% The examples are in the /dataset folder and the plate images are
% relatively well taken in terms of distance, angle, illumination, etc.

% Our general strategy is first crop out the images and use CNN to
% recognize the characters

% This script will focus on finding the positions of the plate in
% the whole image and generate the cropped plate image. Also, we will
% perform some pre-processing techniques like achieving
% rotation-invariance, reducing shading, and noise cancellation.

%% Read images from folder
jpegFiles = dir('dataset/*.jpg'); 
numfiles = length(jpegFiles);
mydata = cell(1, numfiles);

for k = 1:numfiles 
  mydata{k} = imread(strcat('dataset/', jpegFiles(k).name)); 
end

%% convert image to grayscale, then binarization and perform edge detection
% The purpose of edge detection is to remove noise in the original image
test_image = imread('dataset/1.jpg');
test_image = rgb2gray(test_image);

% edge detection is implemented in edge_detect.m using sobel filter
test_image_BW = edge_detect(test_image);
imshow(test
